# Not discontinued!
**This project is neither finished nor discontinued!**  
It may seems so, since the last commit is very long ago, but this or a new version of it is still in development.  
If you want a feature to be added or have any errors, feel free to create an issue, I will look into it.  
Please note that not all errors will be fixed, because this repository is not matching with the current state of development.
